# Smart IoT-Based Parking Management System Using ESP32-CAM and Custom ANPR  Model

This project is a smart parking system using ESP32-CAM and a custom-trained ANPR model for offline number plate recognition. IR sensors detect vehicles at entry and exit points, triggering the camera to capture and process the number plate locally. Recognized entries are logged with timestamps, and a servo motor controls the barrier. A built-in web interface displays real-time status and logs, making the system compact, cost-effective, and ideal for smart campuses or secured premises.
